        "1. This paper is about a component of data cleaning called data tidying which is structuring datasets to facilitate analysis. This is done as the structure of tidy datasets allow tidy tools for data analysis to be developed easily.\n",
        "2. A tidy data standard provides a standard way to to organize data values within a dataset\n",
        "3. This sentence means that due to the same structure for tidy datasets these make them alike, whereas with messy datasets they can be messy in different ways(e.x too much blank data or overpopulation of data).\n",
        "4. Values are defined as either numbers or strings and are organized in two ways. A variable contains all values that measure the same attribute. An observation contains all values measured on the same unit.\n",
        "5. Tidy data is defined with three requirements: each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table.\n",
        "6. The five most common problems with messy datasets are column headers are values not variable names, multiple variables are stored in one column, variables are stored in both rows and columns, multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table, and a single observational unit is stored in multiple tables. The data in table 4 is messy because variables are contained in both the rows and columns. To melt a dataset is turning columns into rows.\n",
        "7. Table 11 is messy as it has a lot of blank data and columns that aren't even needed due to the limited data. Table 12 is almost tidy with the other columns and its structure but the element column contains the names of variables which makes this molten as well.\n",
        "8. The chicken and egg problem with tidy data is that if tidy data is only as useful as the tools that work with it, then tidy tools will be inextricably linked to tidy data. Wickham hopes that other frameworks are developed to help with the other tasks involved with data cleaning such as parsing dates and numbers, identifying missing values, and correcting character encodings"
